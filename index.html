    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="about-grid">
      <div>
        <p>
          I'm an IT Support Engineer who specializes in building calm, reliable, and secure technical
          environments. I’m energized by taking scattered or overly manual processes and turning them
          into systems that feel intuitive, predictable, and genuinely helpful for the people who use them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past several years, I’ve supported distributed teams using Apple hardware, Google
          Workspace, and a wide range of modern SaaS platforms. My work focuses on reducing friction—
          whether that means tightening identity workflows with Okta, improving device posture with Jamf Pro
          and JumpCloud, or designing documentation that makes complex processes understandable.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m especially drawn to the intersection of people, process, and automation. I enjoy creating
          onboarding and offboarding experiences that work the same way every time, implementing secure
          access guardrails, and building repeatable workflows so the “boring but important” parts of IT
          happen quietly in the background.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I spend time in my home lab experimenting with TrueNAS, ZFS, Docker, and
          networking. I use those hands-on projects to test ideas, learn what breaks, and bring back practical,
          battle-tested improvements that strengthen day-to-day operations in the workplace.
